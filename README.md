# esp-backtrace - backtrace for ESP32 bare-metal

Supports the ESP32, ESP32-C2/C3/C6, ESP32-S2/S3 and ESP32H2. Optional exception and panic handlers are included, both of which can be enabled via their respective features.

Please note that when targeting a RISC-V device, you **need** to force frame pointers (i.e. `"-C", "force-frame-pointers",` in your `.cargo/config.toml`); this is **not** required for Xtensa.

You can get an array of backtrace addresses (currently limited to 10) via `arch::backtrace()` if
you want to create a backtrace yourself (i.e. not using the panic or exception handler).

When using the panic and/or exception handler make sure to include `use esp_backtrace as _;`.

When using this together with `esp-println` make sure to use the same output kind for both dependencies.
(Or don't specify the output for `esp-backtrace`)
